 *
 *	   GAPS (px):
 *	   How many pixels between windows and
 *	   screen edges (including bar)
 *	   BORDER_WIDTH (px):
 *	   How thick your border is
 *
 *	   BORDER_FOC_COL (hex):
 *	   The colour of your border when the
 *	   window is focused
 *
 *	   BORDER_UFOC_COL (hex):
 *	   The colour of your border when the
 *	   window is unfocused
 *
 *	   MASTER_WIDTH (float):
 *	   % of the screen the master window
 *	   should take as a decimal value 0-1
 *	   eg. 0.5 is 50%
 *	   
 *	   RESIZE_MASTER_AMT (%):
 *	   % of the master width you want to
 *	   increment by
 *
 *	   MOTION_THROTTLE (int):
 *	   Usually you should set this to your
 *	   screen refreshrate. This is set so
 *	   there is no exessive number of
 *	   requests being sent to the X server
 *
 *	   SNAP_DISTANCE (px):
 *	   How many pixels away from the screen
 *	   until the window *snaps* to the edge
 *
 *	   NUM_WORKSPACES (int):
 *	   This is how many workspaces you want in
 *	   this window manager. Best to leave it
 *	   default (9).
 *
 *	   WORKSPACE_NAMES (char[]):
 *	   This is just the label that will appear
 *	   on your status bar. Doesn't have to be
 *	   a number, it can be anything. Ignore
 *	   the "\0", this is just a NULL that says
 *	   to start again, otherwise it would be
 *	   all of them concatenated together.

/*
 * ———————————————< Bindings >————————————————*
 *
 *     This is where you assign keybinds to
 *     perform some actions.
 *
 *     How do you bind keys? In sxwm, there is
 *     three ways to bind keys to perform
 *     tasks:
 *
 *     BIND, CALL or WORKSPACE.
 *     CALL, calls a function,
 *     BIND, executes a specified
 *     program.
 *     WORKSPACE, sets the bind to move
 *     and item to said workspace or to
 *     change to that workspace.
 *
 *     USEAGE:
 *     	 BIND(MODIFIERS, KEY, FUNCTION)
 *
 *     	 MODIFIERS:
 *     	 The mod keys you want held down
 *     	 for the task to execute. I have
 *     	 also defined SHIFT as a substitute
 *     	 for ShiftMask.
 *
 *     	 KEY:
 *     	 The key to press in combination
 *     	 with the MODIFERS to run the task.
 *
 *     	 FUNCTION:
 *     	 The task to execute. Depending on
 *     	 whether you're calling CALL or
 *     	 BIND, this will execute a program
 *     	 or call a function.
 *
 *     	 If you're
 *     	 calling a function, just put the
 *     	 name of the funtion.
 *
 *     	 Otherwise, put the program you
 *     	 either defined with the CMD above
 *     	 or you can skip that step and just
 *     	 do something like this to create a
 *     	 "string" in the bindings array:
 *
 *     	 { "program", "arg1", NULL }
 *
 *     End the line with a comma, as this is
 *     an array.
